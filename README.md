#SpriteBuilder Swift Penguins

This is a Swift conversion using SpriteBuilder 1.3.1 of the classic [Peeved Penguins]([MakeGamesWith.Us]tutorials/getting-started-with-spritebuilder/) tutorial by [MakeGamesWith.Us]([MakeGamesWith.Us])

Support has been added for the Mac target which is a great way to quickly test your project.

Remeber to publish this in SpriteBuilder before running in Xcode :)

**Important:**

Please don't upgrade this Project if asked just yet in SpriteBuilder as it contains a few fixes that may not be included just yet in SB at time of writing this.

A few Mac patches have been applied and some new CCBReader code.

**Notes:**

A few parts of the original tutorial have been modified where there is no direct translation to Swift from Objective-C, for example performSelector is not available in Swift.
