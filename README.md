#SpriteBuilder Swift Penguins

This is a Swift conversion using SpriteBuilder 1.3.1 of the classic [Peeved Penguins]([MakeGamesWith.Us]tutorials/getting-started-with-spritebuilder/) tutorial by [MakeGamesWith.Us]([MakeGamesWith.Us])

Support has been added for the Mac target which is a great way to quickly test your project.

Issues:
There are a couple of Mac issues that have come up in 1.3.1 however they have been hot patched in this project.

Notes:
A few parts of the original tutorial have been modified where there is no direct translation to Swift from Objective-C, for example performSelector is not available in Swift.
